# mern-mini-url

Full-stack application where you can shorten your links, made with MERN stack. In this repo you can find both server and client code, and some configuration files

# How to install dependencies

Go both to the root and /client directories and run

```
npm i
```

# How to run the project?

Go to the root of the application, and run:

```
npm run dev
```

It will start both front-end(:3000) and back-end(:5000) code

# Database

I've linked my own free cluster from MongoDB, so you can use it to test the app,
create user, and also add and shorten your links
