# Short Your URL

### Dependencies

Go both to the root and /client directories and run

```
npm i
```

### How to run?

Go to the root of the application, and run

```
npm run dev
```

It will start both front-end(:3000) and back-end(:5000)

### Database

I've linked my own free cluster from MongoDB, so you can use it to test the app,
create user, and also add and shorten your links
